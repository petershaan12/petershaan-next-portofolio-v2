👋 Right now I currently work as a backend developer in my company. And today, I want to share some tricks and tips I’ve learned along the way when i become backend engineer. These are based on my experiences as a backend engineer.

### 1. Read API documentation

When youre come to some company you gonna end up with code that written by someone else, unstructural code, some weird comment on some code and also some problem. This is all normal. butttttt the first things you have to do <span style={{ color: "red" }}>is not to fix that</span>, But to read the API documentation. Learn by Reading the document of your appliction is knowing you flow of your company. So its the first things you have to do when you become Backend Engineer.

### 2. Testing Your API ROUTE

Speaking of API routes, let’s talk about [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). Some of you already know it or mybe not, shortly postman It’s an app that helps you test, design, and build your APIs. Before any frontend engineer blames you for non-working APIs, 

<div style={{ display: "flex", justifyContent: "center" }}>

</div>

test everything in Postman first. You can get, send, and even update your data there. Postman is easy to use and lets you organize your routes in folders for easy access later.

### 3. NGROK

Once your code is done and tested, how do you share it with your frontend team? Should you set up your own testing domain?

the answer is NOPE ❌

That’s where [n g r o k](https://ngrok.com/) comes in. It’s a tool that makes your localhost accessible on the internet with a temporary public URL. This is crucial for backend engineers working closely with frontend teams. Just remember, don’t use it for phishing—you’ll get banned.

### 4. Always use git 

Git, especially [GitHub](https://github.com/), is a must-have for any programmer, not just backend developers. Git tracks every change you make, making it easy to revert to previous versions. dont said that you still ctrl+z every file in your vscode 🗿.  In my company, GitHub is a lifesaver. If your latest production build fails, you don’t need to undo all your changes manually. Just revert to your last commit and start from there. So Git is essential when collaborating with other developers.

### 5. Use AI ✨

Don’t be arrogant about not using AI. AI isn’t here to replace us but to make our jobs easier. Not using AI is, frankly, silly. This technology exists to help programmers like us build better applications. However, don’t rely entirely on AI. Learn and build together with it.
